# Python Mega Course

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive dictionary. When run,
the user is prompted to enter a word that they wish to have defined. The word is then searched
for in a provided data set and the definition is produced.

If the user mispells their word, the closest approximation is suggested. If the suggestion is
accurate, then the word is defined. If not, then the program will end with an error message. If no reasonable
approximation can be produced, then the program will end with an error message
